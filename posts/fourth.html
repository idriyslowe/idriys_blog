                <p>This blog is my Frontend playground. I'll be using it to explain personal projects I'm working on in my public Github account.  I'm terrible at talking about myself sans sarcasm so bear with me.  Maybe you'll even get to watch me grow up!  I hope you at least get a nervous chuckle out of this.</p>

                <h2>"space-game"</h2>
                <p>Angular 1 and HTML5 Canvas 2d game.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Collaboration with Michael Vanderwood.</p>
                <p>Recently, my friend Michael approached me with the idea that we build an app together. After a short and awkward silence we came up with "Game, okay a 2d game...". I'm not a gamer but enjoy them when we cross paths. What I did know is it would give us the freedom to experiment. This was going to be a whole new world for me since I'd only ever written a basic text game in Ruby.</p>
                <p>A speedy search of game technologies lead me down some advanced paths but HTML5 Canvas kept popping up. HTML5 produced an element called Canvas with its own methods meant for animating things (perfect for games). Because all of the action happens in the canvas element, the HTML can remain uncluttered. The game logic can be written in Javascript to loop in intervals and the browser will render all the changes.</p>
                <p>At the time, I was regretting my lack of Javascript practice. This would be a great lesson in writing logic in that language since there would be physics involved. To start there would be no backend and no server. We needed a framework to smooth expansion and organize our code. Angular was the JS framework we knew best. The ability to make custom directives made it easy to create and style the canvas element from within the controller code. This made it easy to reference.</p>
                <p>There are a handful of helpful tutorials on the internet of varying levels of difficulty about how to make a 2d Canvas game. All of them were necessary for me to make the first step.</p>
