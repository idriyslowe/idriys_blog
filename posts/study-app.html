                <p style="text-align: center;">This blog is my Frontend playground. I'll be using it to explain personal projects I'm working on in my public Github account.  I'm terrible at talking about myself sans sarcasm so bear with me.  Maybe you'll even get to watch me grow up!  I hope you at least get a nervous chuckle out of this.</p>

            <h3>My first product. Learning to build a RoR app <i>mostly</i> on my own</h3>
            <hr>
            <h3>Github Link ==><a href="https://github.com/idriyslowe/study-app">HERE</a></h3>
            <p>Nevermind the inappropriate hyphen-named repo. I was still learning naming conventions.</p>

            <p>My bootcamp's final project was to make an app of our own designing using whatever tickled our fancies. I chose to being with RoR and it expanded from there.</p>

            <p>Origin Story: Before bootcamp, I tried to study many programming languages and frameworks before having a full grasp of the context of anything I was learning. My notes very quickly went from legible to rat's nest. I didn't plan for all of the side notes and bookmarks. I needed a place to organize my "Look up this term" and "What's the diff between these methods?" notes. Now, I'm not an idiot. I know things like Evernote exist but it was the only thing I could think of... I just learned how to do all of this a second ago!</p>

            <p>I began with a spreadsheet that outlined my tables. <b><em>Environment:</em></b> This is the broadest subject. Think "Programming". <b><em>Notepage:</em></b> An Environment has many of these but each Notepage belongs to an Environment. This is where you'd break "Programming" down to "Rails". <b><em>Note:</em></b> A Notepage has many of these (listed on it's show page). Each one belongs to a Notepage. This are your short notes like you would write in a notebook. Bookmark: These also belong to a Notepage to start but can be changed to belong to an individual note. A <b><em>Bookmark</em></b> object is comprised of a screenshot from the web and a url so the user can see the live page. Comment: Allows users to comment on their own or others' Notepages. This appears on the Notepage. Obviously, I need a <b><em>User</em></b> table (I chose the Devise gem to handle the password encryption).</p>

            <p>The second step was building the Rails site real ugly-like. I generated my models and controllers quickly knowing I'd learn what I was missing in the process. I hand wrote CRUD routes for each resource. I wasn't sure yet what my app would look like at the time so I started building the views in the order that a user would discover them starting with the Environment index, going through Environnment show (listing its Notepages) and terminating at the Notepage show view.</p>

            <p>The Notepage show was baffling for me. I had many ideas about what I wanted the user to be able to do here but they were all too ambitious for the time contraint. Finally, it lists the Notes, Bookmarks, and Comments. One page to rule them all! RoR wasn't going to cause me trouble here. I thought of the user who will be providing lots on input. A user won't want to click a button and wait for a refresh for every edit. It was time for Angular.</p>

            <p>I downloaded the angular.min file and created an Angular NotePage controller to do take over the Note iterations and updates in the view. Using Angular meant that this app needed to communicate... it needed to output data for my Angular controller to consume. Now it's time for JSON.</p>

            <p>My app had to grow from CRUD app to JSON REST API. First try, Jbuilder. Deeply nested JSON with Jbuilder was a terrible and time-consuming failure. I needed to list the Bookmarks that belonged to the Notes that belonged to the Notepage that we were on... all of those things at once. Rabl came to the rescue! Created an API controller folder for namespacing sake. My routes file grew like a weed and were eventually trimmed. Some actions were only called on the API controllers and some on the normal controllers.</p>
