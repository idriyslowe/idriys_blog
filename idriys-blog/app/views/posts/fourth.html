                <h2>Flatten this array:</h2>
                <p>This first problem made me nervous at first glance. Since I've been learning Rails and Bootstrap, I hadn't practiced writing any simple Ruby programs for weeks.</p>
                <p><code>
                    array = ["1", 3, "Home", [4], "Word", [3, "Eight"]]<br>
                    <hr>
                    flat_array = []<br>
                    array.each do |item|<br>
                    if item.is_a? Array<br>
                    item.each do |item|<br>
                    flat_array << item<br>
                    end<br>
                    else flat_array << item<br>
                    end<br>
                    end<br>
                    p flat_array<br>
                </code></p>
                <p>First, I knew I needed to create an array ("flat_array") to store the new flattened array.</p>
                <p>If the array was filled with non-array items, flattening wouldn't be neccessary. I needed a way to deal with the nested arrays. Simple enough... find the arrays with an if statement so I could treat them differently during the rest of the block.</p>
                <p>If the item in the array is another array, iterate through each item in the inner array and shovel them into the array "flat_array".</p>
                <p>For all other items (which are luckily not collections in this example) simply shovel with no fanfare.</p>
                <p>Et Voil√•! I get to print my new flattened array which remains in the same order as the original arrays.</p>

                <h2>Calculate the average (mean) of an array of numbers:</h2>
                <p><code>Driver code:<br>
                    p average([3, 2, 1])  should be 2<br>
                    p average([8, 9])  should be 8.5<br>
                    p average([1, 1, 1, 2])  should be 1.25</code></p>
                    <hr>
                <p><code>
                    input_array = [8, 9]<br>
                    total = 0.0<br>
                    input_array.each do |num|<br>
                      total += num<br>
                    end<br>
                    average = total / input_array.length<br>
                    p average<br>
                </code></p>
                <p>This probably isn't the cleanest code you've ever seen for this type of problem but I wrote it in less than 15 minutes so give me some credit. Early in this program, I need to create a variable that will hold the total of all numbers and since I know the average won't neccessarily be a whole number, I'm declaring the value a float by assigning the decimal, 0.0.</p>
                <p>I iterate through the array, adding each number to the total using the += abbreviated assignment operator. After all that hoopla, I create a variable that will hold the final answer which is the total divided by the original array's length.</p>

                 <h2>Create a hash which groups names by their first letter. The keys are the first letter, the values are arrays of names:</h2>
                <p><code>Driver code:<br>
                    p names_by_first_letter(["Adam", "Charlie", "alex"])<br>
                    should be {"A" => ["Adam"], "a" => ["alex"], "C" => ["Charlie"]}<br>
                    </code></p>
                    <hr>
                <p><code>
                    array = ["Adam", "Charlie", "alex"]
                    name_hash = {}
                    array.each do |name|
                        (name_hash[name[0]] ||= []) << name
                        p name_hash
                      end
                </code></p>
                <p>I have no idea how I accomplished this. The internet helped. That's it.</p>
                <p>JK JK. I got most of the way and needed a nudge to figure out how to shovel into an array that's nested inside of a hash.</p>
                <p>Thank god for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009295/pushing-elements-onto-an-array-in-a-ruby-hash">Stack Overflow.</a> It reminded me that those pipes do some crazy thing.</p>
