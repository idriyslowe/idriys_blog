                <h1>My Coding History</h1>
                <p>My <em>interest</em> in coding begins this year. I took an intro to Ruby class from March to May 2015 at Startup Institute in Chicago (where I live). It focused on Ruby and was supposed to end with an intro to Rails. We never made it.  Writing in Ruby was suprisingly intuitive and I'm ever thankful that it's where I began. Mmmm but that's a lie.</p>
                <p>I began coding in 2007 when I worked as a webstore manager at a comic book production company where part of my job was writing email newsletters using Constant Contact. Weekly XHTML rocked my world. It accidentally crossed the line between neat and ugly layouts often to my dismay. Sometime soon after I quit that painful (unrelated to the newsletter) job, I had to troubleshoot compatability issues between my computer's video card and the Ubuntu operating system. That was a command line adventure that lasted from 10pm through 3am the next morning. Good times. In comparison, Ruby is much smoother of a learning experience. It assumes mostly correctly what the human wants with ver few syntactical hints(is syntactical a word?). I hope you enjoy reading more of my words.</p>

                <h2>Rational Artistry</h2>

                <p>This next bit will be about what it's like to be a rational artist. How I am deciding what will be my capstone.</p>

                <p>I'll talk briefly about what I think my capstone will be and how I need bookmarks to keep all the varying unrelated (word?) subjects in my life separate. Compartmentalization.</p>

                <p>Yeah. This'll be fun.</p>

                <h2>Overcomplication</h2>

                <p>I learned a very important thing about myself during the first week of in-class meetings at ACLTC and what languages I think I know. Oh yeah, talk about ACLTC... Anyhow, I overthink things. I'm overthinking this blog right now. I will talk about that pair programming problem with classes and what I thought I needed to do.</p>

                <span>Now let's talk about P Diddy.</span>

                <p>P Diddy is my favorite test image right now. Enjoy.</p>

                <p>Wow, people really do type a lot of words in these things huh?</p>
