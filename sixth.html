            <h1>Bootcamp Final Project</h1>
            <p>This is supposed to be an accumulation of everything I learned?! Ack!!!</p>

            <h2>Study App: Studere!</h2>

            <p>Studere is the name of my final project. Yes, I know that name is cheesy but I think I was picking fun of myself before anyone else got the chance. At the midway point in the bootcamp, we were supposed to have conceived of a project idea to present to strangers at the end of the course and all I could think about was how hard it was to organize my studies. How about I make an application that helps me organize myself? Easy, right?</p>

            <p>Well, it wasn't easy to wrap my mind around conceiving, designing, building a whole web application myself. At this point in the camp, I just learned what something like that would take... didn't have to apply much of that knowlege yet without being prompted. I'll describe this beast of a project for you kind folks as best I can.</p>

            <p>My first order of business was creating a spreadsheet to collect all of my thoughts. You don't know this about me (unless I'm a worse writer than I thought) but my brain is a circus. Focus to me loosely translates to "gain inspiration from this thing and then move on". Much of what I write here will be a re-interpretation of my notes which were broken down to four sheets in one Googlesheet document.</p>

            <p>I won't bother sharing an image here (you know what lists of words look like) but for your knowlege, the sheets were called:</p> 
            
            <h3>Concept:</h3>
            <p>Listed the features I needed for an MVP.</p>

            <h3>Tables/Controllers:</h3>
            <p>Wireframe, Model descriptions, Any nitty-gritty data-related notes.</p>
              
            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <p>List of tasks STEP BY STEP (I mean it) and hanging questions.</p>

            <h3>Done:</h3>
            <p>Listed all completed tasks in case I needed to go back and check a detail.</p>
            
            <p>Keep reading. The next pose will be more interesting. I promise.</p>
